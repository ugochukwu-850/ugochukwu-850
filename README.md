# üí´ About Me:
## üëã Hey, I'm Ugochukwu Chizaram,<br><br>
I am a Passionate software developer and tech enthusiast with a flair for building innovative solutions. I thrive on challenges and take pride in translating complex concepts into clean, maintainable code and most importantly re-useable code. During the course of this interesting journey , I have come to embrace various technologies and tools like programming languages ~ Python, Rust , frameworks , Algorithms and concepts.<br><br>

### üëä Overcoming Odds & Self-Learning<br><br>
Spawning from a foundation of deficient support , I've encountered a series of challenges. Navigating through a landscape where diversity is still evolving, I've embraced these obstacles as opportunities for growth. <br>From combating imposter syndrome to seeking out resources beyond the mainstream, I've even adapted to working with make shift devices, <br>my journey has been one of resilience and self-discipline. <br>Through sheer determination and a desire for knowledge, <br>I am forging a path that would not only break barriers but also serves as an inspiration for others in similar situations. <br>I'm a firm believer that diversity drives innovation, and I'm committed to being a catalyst for positive change in the tech industry.<br><br>
### üåê Web Developer Extraordinaire<br><br>

### üêç Pythonista & ü¶Ä Rustacean<br><br>
My love for coding languages extends to Python and Rust, I guess that should be __from Python to Rust__ where I've honed my skills in creating efficient, reliable, and secure applications. I'm fascinated by Rust's memory safety, security, and runtime magic whilst amused by Python's versatility, ease of use and OOP system. I'm constantly exploring ways to merge their strengths for optimal results.<br><br>
